            <p>
                I am from Idaho Falls and I am studying software engineering. I have spent most of my life in Idaho but I have also lived in Guatemala (the Guatemala Cob√°n Mission) and Yucatan, Mexico. I speak English, Spanish, and Q'eqchi' (also spelled Kekchi). I currently work as a Q'eqchi' interpreter for the US Immigration Courts and hope to make translation software after I graduate.

                Idaho is known for potatoes and the great outdoors. It is in the North-West of the United States and borders Canada. Home to a part of Yellowstone National Park, Lucky Peak State Park, Thousand Springs State Park, Bruneau Dunes State Park, Nez Perce National Historical Park, Shoshone Falls Park, Minidoka National Historic Site, Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, Farragut State Park, Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument, City of Rocks National Reserve, Craters of the Moon National Monument, Targhee National Forrest, etc. Ben Wyatt on Parks and Rec was right when he said, "Idaho is basically one big park."
